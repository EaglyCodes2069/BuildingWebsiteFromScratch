                        <h1>Hello thanks for visiting my site</h1>

                        <p>My name is Robert Eagly, I work as a Technical
                            Specialist in the engineering department of MEI.
                            Though I have enjoyed the opportunities and
                            experiences as a maintenance technician etc. I feel
                            that I will be more fulfilled working in the
                            software/web development field. So please bear with
                            me as I practice front end web development in
                            pursuit of my new career path. I have found
                            enjoyment out of learning to write code in order to
                            create my own products. I know I have a long way to
                            go,
                            but I have no intentions on slowing down. </p>


                        <p> In addition to me currently striving towards a new
                            career path, below is a list of other hobbies I
                            enjoy.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Spending time with my family</li>
                            <li>Fishing, Fresh or Salt water</li>
                            <li>Playing Guitar</li>
                            <li>Reading</li>
                            <li>Learning new things</li>
